# Cyber Chaos Cards - CCC

A Cards against Humanity clone online game.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into two primary sections:

- `client`: This is the frontend of the application powered by Next.js.
- `server`: This is the backend of the application handling API and data-related operations.

Additionally, there's a `types` folder which contains shared types and utilities that both the `client` and `server` might need access to.


## Setting up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IgorBayerl/CCC-Cards-Game.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the dependencies with `pnpm`

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Servers**

   To start the dev server of both, `client` and `server`:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   to start just the `server`:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev-server
   ```

   to start just the `client`:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev-client
   ```
